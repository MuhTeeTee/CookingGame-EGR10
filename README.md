Scope of the Project

This project is the final project for an EGR 10 engineering class, created by a team of four engineering students. 
The game is not intended to be overly complicated. Instead, it focuses on trying something totally different and 
applying engineering concepts and principles learned throughout the engineering course.

The Future

As of now, there are no plans to continue the development of "Magical PB and J Adventure - EGR 10" after the completion of the 
EGR 10 course. However, the project has provided the team with valuable experiences in developing a VR game and 
applying engineering principles in a novel context. We hope that everyone had fun trying something new and creating 
something they never thought they could.
